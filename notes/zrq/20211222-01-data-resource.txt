    Removed sections on publishing - add them if/when we need them.


```yaml
    data-resources:
      - name: "example"
        description: |
            A template for a data resource.
        cardinality: [single|container]
        mimetype: [mime-type]

        ....

        # Publish the data making it accessible from outside.
        publish:
            protocol: [http|scp|S3|nfs|...]
            url: "...."
            accessmode: [
                readonlyonce,
                readonlymany,
                readwriteonce,
                readwritemany
                ]
            accesscontrol: [
                public,
                protected,
                private
                ]
            lifetime: [ISO_8601 Duration]
```

Likewise, the task writes the results to a known location inside the container. The execution platform automagically pushes the results to the remote webdav server and makes them available on a publicly readable webserver for one hour.


```yaml
    data-resources:

        ....

      # The results.
      - name: "results"
        description: |
            The list of results, downloadable as a VOTable file.


        # Publish the data making it accessible from outside.
        publish:
            protocol: "http"
            url: "http://www.example.org/path/c59bbae5-fe0e-455d-9320-e073e83e8398"
            accessmode: "readonlymany"
            accesscontrol: "public"
            lifetime: "PT1H"
```

    ....
    In addition, the external URL of the published results may depend on the configuration of the platform executing the task, and so would be filled in as part of the response when the task is executed.

    ....
    Adding functionality to publish the data on a website may sound complex, but it may turn out to be easier to implement than managing the credentials to enable the execution platform to write the results to a remote server using the user's credentials.
