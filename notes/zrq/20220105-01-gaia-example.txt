    Using Gaia as an example.
    BigData analytics platform.

    1) Automated Kubernetes deployment
    2) Data stored in echo S3 (UK)
    3) Data copied to Rucio ..
        rucio UK ..
        rucio EU ..

    small, medium and large tests
        need different node count and memory per node
        zeppelin/worker nodes have a different memory profile

    small test = gaia-source, proper motions
    medium test = gaia-source, train classifier
    large test = gaia-source, identify clustering
