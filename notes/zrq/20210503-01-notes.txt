Everyone agrees to use the same technology.
Everyone agrees to use the same version of the same technology.
    Docker version xx
    Binder version xx
    DIRAC version xx

    Doesn't scale well over time.
    As soon as one site decides to use a different technology, their platform is no longer compatible with the others.
    Multiple incompatible forks.


Everyone agrees to use the same set of interfaces on top of their local technology.

    ESCAPE compute platform xx
    IVOA compute platform xx

    Easier to scale accross different sites.
    If the interface is an abstraction of core behaviour, and designed to be extensible, then it can be adapted to new technologies when they arrive.
    If different projects develop to the same interface then they can use each others software.
