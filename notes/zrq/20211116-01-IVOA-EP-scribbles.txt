Before we consider the specifics of executing computing tasks,
it may be useful to look at what we are trying to address
from a more abstract perspective.

Consider the world of online shopping.
There are many different types of shops, selling many different types of goods.

From a small, local physical shop or restaurant who take accept online orders for local delivery,
to the large multi-national online warehouse stores like Amazon.

All of them provide a website, but few if any provide a machine readable webservice interface.


If we wanted to develop a common webservice interface that would work for all of them,
we might start with asking "Can I buy <product-type> from your shop?".

To develop this into a standard we could try to define a vocabulary for product types that could be sold in shops,
but the danger is this would rapidly expand into an attempt to define a hirerachical taxonomy of pretty much everything in the world.

Alternativley, we could concantrate on the grammar of the request and response messages
that make up the webservice interface, and leave it up to the
individual communities to define the product types
they are interested in.

As an example, we could consider a local shop that sells fruit and vegetables, and a shop that sells books.

We can ask each of them if they sell the type of item we are interested in.

    "Can I buy apples from your shop?"

Before we consider the specifics of executing computing tasks,
it may be useful to look at what we are trying to address
from a more abstract perspective.

Consider the world of shopping.
There are many different types of shops, selling many different types of goods.

From small local shops in our town to the large multi-national online warehouse stores like Amazon.

If we wanted to develop a common interface that would work for all of them,
we might start by building a search engine that we could query to find shops
that sell the things we want.

We could try to build a human readable natural language search,
that could distinguish between
a vegetable shop that sells potatoes and apples,
a book shop that sells receipe books,
and a computer shop that sells laptops.

Or, we could try to define a machine readable taxonomy
of things that could be sold in shops that would be able to
distinguish between differnt types of things.

    vegetable.potatoe
    fruit.apple
    book.receipe.soup.potatoe
    computer.laptop.apple

I think in the long run we will probably these kind of search interfaces,
but the danger is that both of these approaches are fairly large tasks
in themselves, and even if we did succed, we still can't buy things from shops.

An alternative approach would be to concentrate on the mechanics of 'buying things
from shops', and leave the vocabularies to the individual communities.

In our local town we have ~30 different shops, so rather than spending time
defining a searchable vocabulary, we could just go and ask each of them if they sell
the things we want to buy.

    "Can I buy <product-type> from your shop?".

In order to do this, I would need to know the name of the thing I want to buy.
Putting aside the problem of a visitor from a foregign country to later,
it is probably safe to assume that if I want to buy something, I probably know the name of it.

Or at least, my name for it.

    "Can I buy 'potatoes' from your shop?".

The hairdressesrs, wine shop, cafe and book shop would not understand what I was
talking about, but the vegetable shop and local supermarket would understand
because types of vegetables are their speciality.

Lets say we find

one vegatable shop and two supermarkets who sell potatoes

The shops themselves would be struxtured differently
In the vegaratbel shop,
I would select the individual potatoes from the ones on display,
the shop keeper would weigh them and then charge me the
price based on the total weight.

In the supermarket, the potatoes would be offered already packaged in bags
of fixed weight, 1kg, 5kg etc.
I would select a bag of potatoes, and the shop keeper would
scan a bar code on the bag and chagre me a fixed price for that size of bag.
