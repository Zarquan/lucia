        WP3+WP5 metadata coordination

            * the zenodo interface can serve for the discovery of the workflow from ESAP (analogous to pulling a repository through Zenodo DOI in mybinder)
            * the "environment.yml" defines the environment for the notebooks in the repository
            * the workflow is defined in the repository - for integration, the question of granularity (full flow in one step or modularization?) has to be addressed.

    Common WP3+WP5 call - 23 April 2021 (missed)
    https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/24035/

        John Swinbank :

            Interactive Data Analysis WG “reboot”.

                Focus on demonstrating practical integration of ESAP with a Jupyter system.
                Nice link to ongoing “metadata task force” HCG-16 project: this should provide the enabling technology to make it possible to run notebooks through ESAP.

            IDA WG driving focus on ESAP architecture.

                Write-up on this will be forthcoming.

            Worthwhile discussion meetings with WP2 + WP4.

                WP2 + WP5 collaboration focused on “DAC21” challenge. Opportunity for WP3 involvement here (“Collaboration with WP3 for software repos, image registry, etc” from that document).
                WP4 tech forum: Dave Morris raised prospect of innovative APIs for scheduling work. Not yet fully understood if/how this fits in to the big picture of WP3/5 interaction.


        Elena Cuoco, Jutta Schnabel, Kay Graf

            Outcome of WP3+WP5 metadata meeting (@WP5 monthly meeting): HCG-16 use case: mybinder & Zenodo metadata
            Software onboarding continuing
            IWAPP follow-up: Setting up workflow for MM and ML integration
            WP3 contribution to “DAC21” challenge.
            Inclusion of software catalogues queries on OSSR or ESAP?

    ---------------- ----------------

    Target use case:

        Pipeline for HCG-16 Project
        https://github.com/AMIGA-IAA/hcg-16

            Not registered in Zenodo yet ?

        Notebooks for plots are in a subdirectory
        .. plot_scripts/*.ipynb
        .. plot_scripts/Fig1-DECaLS_grz_image.ipynb


    Example from Zenodo:

        cosimoNigro/agnpy
            https://github.com/cosimoNigro/agnpy/tree/v0.0.10
            https://zenodo.org/record/4687123

        Notebooks for tutorials are in a subdirectory
         .. docs/tutorials/*.ipynb
         .. docs/tutorials/absorption_targets.ipynb

    WP5 interactive analysis telecon
    26th April

        3 different methods for launching notebooks

        JupyterHub REST API
        pop-up JupyterHub + REST API
        binder

        MVP IS focussing on binder

        Looks like they will end up adopting binder because it meets the 80/20 rule.
        Metadata will be 'whatever binder needs'

        Hook to integrate with CanIDoThis API ?

            type=https://purl.escape.eu/task-type/mybinder-1.0
            link=http://..../

        Given that, then the ESCAPE IDA project defines the content of the metadata
