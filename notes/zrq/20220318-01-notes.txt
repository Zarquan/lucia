    Hi Sara, Dave,
    Please let Aleem and myself know if you have any problems with this step.
    Cheers,

    DESY (like many other institutes) has its own IAM service.  The DESY IAM
    service does not use INDIGO-IAM (it's more sophisticated), and so is
    *completely* independent from ESCAPE INDIGO-IAM instance.

    So, I wouldn't worry about this.

    Please contact the DESY IT secretary requesting that they create the
    appropriate entry for you (and for Dave?).
