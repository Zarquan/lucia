If there is only one service type, then we need to get both Christine and Stefano to agree on one way to execute Docker

Sara Bertocco  6 hours ago
But as commented Carlo, the protocol does not say how to execute, but only how to exchange info

Dave Morris  6 hours ago
The EP offers the available services, it doesn't do the execution.

Dave Morris  6 hours ago
It is up to the developers of each service-type to define how their service is used

Dave Morris  6 hours ago
Dave&Sara define how the "simple-docker-uws" works

Dave Morris  6 hours ago
Stefano defines how the "rosetta-docker-api" works

Dave Morris  6 hours ago
Christine defines how the "rubin-docker-api" works (edited)

Sara Bertocco  6 hours ago
yes, but how they interoperate? I'm loosing myself

Dave Morris  6 hours ago
the three servicetypes don't interoperate

Dave Morris  6 hours ago
we encourage Stefano and Christine to also implement the "basic-docker-uws" interface

Dave Morris  6 hours ago
the "basic-docker-uws" is interoperable (edited)

Dave Morris  6 hours ago
then perhaps Christine creates a really useful interface for Rubin

Dave Morris  6 hours ago
and Stefano chooses to add the "rubin-docker-api" interface to Rosetta (edited)

Dave Morris  6 hours ago
other people in ESCAPE choose to add "rosetta-docker-api" to their services

Dave Morris  6 hours ago
as more people choose to implement more interfaces we gradually get interoperability

Dave Morris  6 hours ago
the best interfaces will be the most popular ones

Dave Morris  6 hours ago
(*) this is really useful to discuss between us before we try to talk to Christine and Stefano

Dave Morris  6 hours ago
helps me to get the ideas clear in my head and how to describe them

Dave Morris  6 hours ago
and to see where the ideas don't make sense

Sara Bertocco  6 hours ago
It is difficult because I do not understand the way we are keeping. In my opinion our note was clear and useful. Now I do not know how to map this proliferation of api in the standard we are trying to define.
Probably it could be better and faster if we open a video conf and try to chat

Sara Bertocco  6 hours ago
visually

Dave Morris  5 hours ago
talking with voice we get the first answer, not the best answer

Dave Morris  5 hours ago
with text we can pause for 20 min to think of the better answer

Dave Morris  5 hours ago
this is interesting, because it shows the text in the note is not clear

Dave Morris  4 hours ago
I thought the note did cover the many to many mapping between taskstypes and service types, but I can see now that it is not clear (edited)

Sara Bertocco  4 hours ago
I think we should not loose the point of our proposal. Our intention was to cover a simple use case: "can I do this?". We decided to not cover complex situations like for example slurm clusters. We need to have a solid base on simple use cases before to tackle complex situations

Dave Morris  4 hours ago
Ok, not quite what I was thinking.

Dave Morris  4 hours ago
For me, the idea behind the 'canIdothis' interface is that it is capable of handling really simple cases all the way up to really complicated Kubernetes deployments, because of the way it is designed.

Dave Morris  4 hours ago
to be accurate, "can I do this?" is not a use case

Dave Morris  4 hours ago
to be a use case, you need to define what the 'this' is

Dave Morris  4 hours ago
can I do 'simple docker containers' is more of a use case

Dave Morris  4 hours ago
can I do 'complicated slurm clusters' is a another use case

Dave Morris  4 hours ago
the execution planner interface can handle both, because it doesn't look at the details inside

Sara Bertocco  4 hours ago
Yes, but when a scientist needs to deploy a complicated cluster on kubernates or a slurm cluster to run his analysis?
I think we are loosing the point. We are not providing administrators with a service to deploy infrastructures. We are trying to find a way to easily exploit already existing infrastructures

Sara Bertocco  3 hours ago
this is about the Christine comment on helm

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
you assuming it takes an expert to deploy a cluster - which is not true

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
the work we have done for the Gaia ML platform automates the whole deployment

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
so yes, a scientist could take the Kubernetes configuration we have in git hub, and deploy that on a generic Kubernetes cluster by passing one configuration file to deploy the full analysis system

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
the whole system would live long enough to complete the analysis task, ~9hrs, and then be deleted

Sara Bertocco  3 hours ago
This is much more complex than what I have in mind

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
OpenStack has a REST API that can create a Kubernetes cluster from four parameters, the number of nodes and their size

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
this isn't complicated

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
it sounds scary - but it isn't

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
----
we can run a single hello-world docker container by passing a URL reference for the container image to a service that handles containers
----
we can run a full 20 node, 200 core, 400G memory Spark cluster, by passing a URL reference to set of files that contains the cluster configuration
----
both cases are evaluated based on the name of the task-type and URLs to their parameters
----
execution planner doesn't look inside the box, it just passes simple messages

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
----
if someone else (a software developer) has created the task config, a scientist can take it off the shelf and run it

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
OK, step back a bit, you said "this is much more complex that what I have in mind"

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
Can you describe to me what you were thinking of ?

Sara Bertocco  3 hours ago
I was thinking specifically to a LOFAR pipeline requiring a container with a specific software with a set of dependencies installed on it.
I was not thinking to the need to install an infrastructure "complex", meaning including different nodes with different roles, and runningsome software on it

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
So your use case would be covered by can I execute 'simple-docker-container' ?

Sara Bertocco  3 hours ago
yes

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
Using a 'simple-docker-uws' Service to implement the server side?

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
request task-type=simple-docker-container

Sara Bertocco  3 hours ago
probably yes, not sure because, probably Stefano will argue that rosetta does not need a uws to run a container

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
Does Rosetta have a REST API ?

Sara Bertocco  3 hours ago
If I remember well, Stefano said "no"

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
For now, assume Rosetta does have a REST API

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
Dave implements 'simple-docker-uws' in Edinburgh, and Stefano implements 'rosetta-rest-api' at INAF.

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
both implementations also have an EP service attached to them

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
your client asks both EP services can I do 'simple-docker-container'

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
Daves UWS implementation replies with YES and service-type = 'simple-docker-uws' and Stefano's service replies with YES and service-type = 'rosetta-rest-api'

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
your client also asks  5 other services the same question, but they only handle Jupyter notebooks so they just reply with NO

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
now you know there are 2 services that can perform your task, and you know what interfaces they are offering

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
end of

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
that is all that the EP service does

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
it is up to your client to decide which service it wants to use

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
it may be that your client only understands 'rosetta-rest-api', in which case you ignore the Edinburgh service and use the INAF service (edited)

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
it may be that the INAF service doesn't provide enough cpu cores or memory, so your client chooses the Edinburgh service instead

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
to start with, the two services themselves are not interoperable

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
but it is a start

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
later in the year, CDS deploys a 'rosetta-rest-api' service

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
so now there are two instances to choose from

Sara Bertocco  3 hours ago
And this is the way to work described in our note

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
a little later, Stefano to adds 'simple-docker-uws' to Rosetta

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
so now there is more choice

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
the request and response are the simple JSON examples in the document and presentation

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
    {
    "tasktype": "uri://docker-container",
    "taskinfo": {
        "image": "docker.io/example:1.0"
        }
    }

Dave Morris  3 hours ago

    "reponseword": "YES",
    "servicetype": "uri://docker-uws",
    "serviceinfo": {
        "endpoint": "http://example.org/dkuws",
        }
    }

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
keep the same message structure, but change the words

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
    {
    "tasktype": "uri://complex-kubernetes-deploy",
    "taskinfo": {
        "config": "http:///github.com/Zarquan/complicated-project"
        }
    }

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
    {
    "reponseword": "YES",
    "servicetype": "uri://complex-kubernetes-service",
    "serviceinfo": {
        "endpoint": "http://cloud.ed.ac.uk/controller",
        }
    }

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
Execution planner can handle both, because it doesn't look inside the message

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
the target Service needs to be able to understand 'uri://complex-kubernetes-deploy'

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
but to ExecutionPlanner, is is a string with 31 characters

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
the client needs to know how to use 'uri://complex-kubernetes-service'

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
but to EP, it is a string with 32 characters

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
the content of the task-info and service-info blocks may change

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
    {
    "tasktype": "uri://complex-kubernetes-deploy",
    "taskinfo": {
        "config": "http:///github.com/Zarquan/complicated-project"
        "param-one": 270,
        "param-two": 'curlew'
        "param-three": 'disabled'
        }
    }

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
but if a service doesn't understand 'uri://complex-kubernetes-deploy'

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
then it just ignores the whole task-info block anyway

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
----
Does that help ?

Sara Bertocco  3 hours ago
yes

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
this is what I need to put in the document

Dave Morris  3 hours ago
thank you

Dave Morris  2 hours ago
explaining it this way helps me to see that the document is wrong

Dave Morris  2 hours ago
and the presentation could be better

Sara Bertocco  2 hours ago
It is clear. But, apologize if I come from grid experience,  such kind of computation distribution poses a problem in fair sharing of resources

Dave Morris  2 hours ago
no apologiy needed, it is good to have you asking questions and making me explain more

Dave Morris  2 hours ago
each time I explain I also learn more myself

Dave Morris  2 hours ago
what problems with resource shareing are you concerned about ?

Sara Bertocco  2 hours ago
if more than a user at the same time require to deploy and run software on a computing center, the service can respond "yes, I can" but then resources can be not enough for both users. I know, this problem can always be present, but if a users asks to run a procedure requiring 16 cores you have less chance to saturate the service than if a user asks to run 8 nodes with 16 cores. I'm usin explanatory numbers, I know that numbers are relative to the dimension of the data center. So, more "complex" and resource consuming is the computational requirement, higher is the risk of failures for "not enough resources". Writing I understand that this risk is always present. Probably we can figure a specific error in uws-docker

Dave Morris  2 hours ago
yes, totally agree - that is in version 2 of the EP

Dave Morris  2 hours ago
when-can-i-run-this ?

Dave Morris  2 hours ago
Adding a bit more to the message structure and the service can reply with
'not today, but I can offer 2 hours on Tuesday or 4 hours on Wednesday'

Dave Morris  2 hours ago
part of EPs evolves into a scheduling/booking service

Dave Morris  2 hours ago
similar to the resources block, a calendar block in the messages that presents the user with choices about when they can run their task

Dave Morris  2 hours ago
defaults to 'now', but if the task takes a lot of resources, or the server is very busy, the server can offer calendar booking slots

Dave Morris  2 hours ago
the client can choose to accept one of the slots offered, and it is registered in the schedule on the server

Dave Morris  2 hours ago
we have exactly this use case with the Gaia compute platform

Dave Morris  2 hours ago
some of the analysys tasks are small and only take a small fraction of the available resources, so we can run many of these at the same time

Dave Morris  2 hours ago
some of them use more than 50% of the available resources for several hours, so they need to be booked into a schedule because we can only run one at  time

Dave Morris  2 hours ago
between bookings we can delete the current cluster and create a new one with different configurations

Sara Bertocco  1 hour ago
:+1:

Dave Morris  1 hour ago
that I was leaving to version 2

Dave Morris  1 hour ago
I think if we tried to put that in the document now people would object
