    Why do we have the IVOA prefix on our GitHub projects ?
    Looks naff once we transfer them to the IVOA organization.

    CodeOfConduct

        Rename IVOA-CodeOfConduct to CodeOfConduct (done)
        Transfer to IVOA organization

    ContainerExecutionService

        Create UWSContainerExecutionService in IVOA organization
        Install latex source from Overleaf
        Install GitHub actions from ExecutionPlannerNote

    ExecutionPlanner

        Rename IVOA-ExecutionPlannerNote to ExecutionPlannerNote
        Check with Sara before we do this

        Experiment with Java and JSON/YAML parsers.
        Need to choose between JSON and YAML POST messages.
        If we follow Kubernetes, post YAML, read JSON.

        Reasons:

            YAML has comments
            YAML has multi-line text
            Both good for user edited content

            Ansible is YAML
            Kubernetes is YAML

            Can the YAML parser cope with unknown elements ?

        Do we introduce multiple nodes in this version ?

            min and max memory apply to the whole job
            current specification creates a single node and runs the container/composition in that
            later versons will support multi node deployments

            Look at the Kubernetes system specification again.
            Can't find it ... need more GoogleFoo

            How does min/max work for a cluster config ?
            Do we adopt the "node-[00-07]" syntax from Ansible ?
            Leave it for later, too many questions for now.

        Identity and group membership

            We need a local IAM and GMS to check group membership.
            .. or a Mock GMS ?

        Java interfaces

            Create a RuleChecker interface.

                boolean check(TaskRequest request, TaskResponse response)
                    {
                    }
