    task-type anyURI

    Can be just a URN, but better to have a URL.
    If it is a URL, it should point to a resource that describes the type.

        It MAY be a HTML resource.
        It MAY be a JSON resource.
        It MAY use HTTP accepts header to choose between them.
        It MAY use a URL shortening service to create a persisten URI.

    For brevity, this doc will use short form xxxx://types for type URLs.
    The URLS do not need to be part of the same domain.
    Anyone can define a type, all they need is a URL.
