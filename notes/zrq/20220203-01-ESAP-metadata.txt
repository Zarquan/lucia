    We can direct MyBinder to specific directories and notebopoks using 'urlpath'

    * https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/norvig/pytudes/HEAD?urlpath=lab/tree/ipynb
    * https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/norvig/pytudes/HEAD?urlpath=lab/tree/ipynb/Advent%202017.ipynb

    More info on passing params to Binder
    https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/sample_repos.html#create-a-binder-link-that-points-to-jupyterlab

    Interesting test would be two directories in the same repo each containing a ipynb notebook and a requirements.txt config file.
    Does Binder only use the local requirements.txt, or would it also get the requirements.txt from a top level directory ?
    Test and document ....

    Installing and experimenting with Portainer ..

    Portainer UI design doesn't allow us to use URLs as URLs !!
    The user interface is broken by design.
    https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/724
    https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/613

    They are putting everything in the fragment part of the URL.

    endpoint    https://localhost:9443/
    fragment    #!/2/docker/containers/096c5d4f34b75ed704a2658a17f7e0e04fac2f4adbaeeacd03c42348b1d81231

    Broken by design.
