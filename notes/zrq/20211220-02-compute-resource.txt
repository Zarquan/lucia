Example metadata for describing the compute resources required by an executable component.

The metadata for this would either be stored in a YAML file linked to the component, or as a `string` attribute of the component registration.

```yaml

    compute-resources:

    - name: "example-instance"
      description: |
          A template for a computing resource.

      # The minimum and maximum number of cores.
      mincores: 1234
      maxcores: 1234

      # The minimum and maximum memory (SI units + binary).
      minmemory: 1234 GiB
      maxmemory: 1234 GiB

      # The list of storage resources required.
      storage:

        - name: "workspace"
          type: [ephemeral|persistent]
          path: "/data/workspace"
          minsize: 1234 GiB
          maxsize: 1234 GiB

````





      # The minimum and maximum startup time (ISO 8601 period).
      minstartup: PTnHnMnS
      maxstartup: PTnHnMnS

      # The minimum and maximum duration (ISO 8601 period).
      minduration: PTnHnMnS
      maxduration: PTnHnMnS
