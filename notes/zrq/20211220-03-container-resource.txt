Example metadata for describing an executable container.

Each OSSR component registered in Zenodo will need to have a metadata description for each container in the project.

This metadata can either be stored in a YAML file linked to the component,
at a well known location (`esap-containers.yml`) in the source code for the component,
or as a `string` attribute of the component registration.

Note that this needs to be a hirerarchical tree of metadata.
Each container in the list will need to have a separate section for the compute resources and data resources for that continer.

```yaml

    containers:

    - name: "example"
      description: |
          A template for an executable container.

      type: [docker|singularity|oci]
      version: ""

      binary-image:
        format: [raw|targzip]
        url: [url]

      build-source:
        url:  [url]

      ports:
        - name: "portname"
          protocol: "tcp"
          internal: 8080
          external: 8080
        - name: "portname"
          protocol: "tcp"
          internal: 8081
          external: 8081
        environment:
        - name:  "ENV_NAME"
          value: "xxxx"
        - name:  "ENV_NAME"
          value: "xxxx"

      compute-resources:

        # A list of the compute resources needed by this container.

      data-resources:

        # A list of the data resources needed by this container.

```
