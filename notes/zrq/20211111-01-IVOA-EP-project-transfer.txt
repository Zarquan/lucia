    Preview badge works :-)

# -----------------------------------------------------

    So we have a working GitHub repository, with build and preview actions in place.
    Next step is to transfer it to the IVOA organisation.

    https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository

        new owner : ivoa
        confirm name : Zarquan/IVOA-ExecutionPlannerNote


        Please select any teams you wish to have access to ivoa/IVOA-ExecutionPlannerNote.
            <none>

        Moving repository to ivoa/IVOA-ExecutionPlannerNote. This may take a few minutes.
