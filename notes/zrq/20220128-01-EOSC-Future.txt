    EOSC-Future Compute Continuum WG

        Same use case as IVOA-EP and ESAP
        "Where can I run <x>?"

        Trying to do ExecPlanning using a searchable registry of compute platforms.
        Defining the metadata to register available services and platforms.
        I think it is useful to define a schema and collect this metadata, but won't be the complete solution.

    EOSC Future working groups
    https://wiki.eoscfuture.eu/display/PUBLIC/Working+Groups

        Working Groups are expected to demonstrate an impact on the work of WP3 and more in general of EOSC Future.
        Some areas of interest had been identified during the project proposal preparation.
        These include but are not limited to:

            * Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)
            * Authentication and Authorisation Infrastructure (AAI)
            * Science Use Cases (requirements for the EOSC Architecture gathered from the scientific communities)
            * Composability (EOSC Execution Framework to facilitate cross-cluster resource composition)
            * Metadata (common modeling of metadata schemas and crosswalks)
            * Compute-as-a-Service (standard interfaces to access EOSC Compute resources)
            * Container deployment (standard interfaces to deploy and manager container clusters in EOSC), Security, FAIR.

        For more information on WP3 objectives please refer to the EOSC Future Wiki.
